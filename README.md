# Color Me Gorgeous - Seasonal AI Color Analyzer

Welcome to **Color Me Gorgeous**, a Seasonal Color Analyzer designed for the Myntra HackerRamp: 2024. This project aims to enhance the shopping experience on the Myntra website by helping users determine their seasonal color palette, such as Autumn, Spring, Winter , Summer. Your color season determines which kind of colors harmonise with you. This knowledge is therefore of great benefit when creating your personal color palette.

## Project Description

Color Me Gorgeous is an application that allows users to upload a picture and analyze their seasonal shades. But finding out which color season you are can be tricky.
For this we have designed a website to help you determine which of the twelve color seasons you fall into. By identifying their seasonal color, users can make better fashion choices that complement their natural coloring. The project leverages various technologies, including Machine Learning,Bootstrap, Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle, and Python.

## Tech Stack Used

- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and attractive UI design.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Kaggle**: For datasets and machine learning models.
- **Python**: As the core programming language.
- **Machine Learning**: To extract the tones and recommend the colors
